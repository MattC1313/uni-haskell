# Uni-Haskell
Collection of smaller university projects that were programmed using Haskell as part of my COMP105 Programming Paradigms module, including assignments and weekly homework.

Here is a brief of what topics each homework covers:
- hw1:
-   what is a pure function
-   loading in files to the ghci
-   making my own functions
- hw2:
-   The 'if' and 'let' statements
-   Tuples and lists
-   List functions
-   List ranges and comprehension (includes FizzBuzz)
-
